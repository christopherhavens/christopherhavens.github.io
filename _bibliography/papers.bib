  abstract={The transcendence of the regular infinite continued fraction {$\{\mathfrak z\} = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \ldots$} was first proven by C. L. Siegel in 1929. The value of {$ \{\mathfrak z\}$} is a ratio of the values of modified Bessel functions. In this paper our diophantine analysis around {$\{\mathfrak z\}$} takes its starting point with its rational convergents and deals with an asymptotic approximation formula for {$\{\mathfrak z\}$} and with the construction of a sequence of quadratically irrational approximations using these convergents. Finally, we study various error sums for {$\{\mathfrak z\}$} which are also defined by the rational convergents.}

  abstract={For {$\alpha_0$} an infinite continued fraction and  a linear fractional transformation, we study the continued fraction expansion of {$\sigma(\alpha_0)$} and its convergents. We provide the continued fraction expansion of \sigma(\alpha_0) for four general families of continued fractions and when |\det(\sigma)| = 2. We also find nonlinear recurrence relations among the convergents of \sigma(\alpha_0) which allow us to highlight relations between convergents of \alpha_0 and \sigma(\alpha_0). Finally, we apply our results to some special and well-studied continued fractions, like Hurwitzian and Tasoevian ones, giving a first study about leaping convergents having steps provided by nonlinear functions.}
