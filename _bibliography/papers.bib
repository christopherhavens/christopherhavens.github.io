  abstract={The transcendence of the regular infinite continued fraction . z :=
[1,2,3,4,5,... ] was first proven by C. L. Siegel in 1929. The value of . zis a
ratio of the values of modified Bessel functions. In this paper our diophantine
analysis around. ztakes its starting point with its rational convergents and deals with
an asymptotic approximation formula for. zand with the construction of a sequence
of quadratically irrational approximations using these convergents. Finally, we
study various error sums for. zwhich are also defined by the rational convergents.}

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
