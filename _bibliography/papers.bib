  abstract={For \alpha_0 an infinite continued fraction and  a linear fractional transformation, we study the continued fraction expansion of \sigma(\alpha_0) and its convergents. We provide the continued fraction expansion of \sigma(\alpha_0) for four general families of continued fractions and when |\det(\sigma)| = 2. We also find nonlinear recurrence relations among the convergents of \sigma(\alpha_0) which allow us to highlight relations between convergents of \alpha_0 and \sigma(\alpha_0). Finally, we apply our results to some special and well-studied continued fractions, like Hurwitzian and Tasoevian ones, giving a first study about leaping convergents having steps provided by nonlinear functions.}

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
